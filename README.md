A Java-Hibernate based system to evaluate employee performance using KPIs and generate reports
  - Vijaya K, Senior Faculty, Deep Tech, Anudip Foundation
Project Scope
  - Evaluate employee performance using measurable KPIs
  - Allow managers to record scores for each KPI twice a year
  - Automatically calculate weighted scores
  - Generate half-yearly performance reports with comments
  - Maintain department, employee, KPI, and review data in a structured database
Technology Stack
  - Frontend: Console-based Java UI
  - Backend: Core Java
  - ORM: Hibernate (JPA)
  - Database: MySQL
  - Tools: Eclipse, Maven 
  - Others: ANSI Colors for console output formatting
Key Features / Modules
  - Department Management
  - Employee Management (Add, Update, Delete and view all employees)
  - KPI Management (Add, List)
  - Performance Review Entry (H1 & H2)
  - Report Generation per Employee and per Year

Project Architecture
  - **Layered Architecture:**
  - Presentation Layer: Main class (EPESApp.java)
  - Service Layer: Business logic (PerformanceService, ReportService, etc.)
  - DAO Layer: Hibernate-based DB interaction (DAO classes)
  - Entity Layer: JPA Entities (Employee, Department, KPI, etc.)

Sample Workflow
  1. Manager adds Department and Employees.
  2. Defines KPIs.
  3. Reviews employee KPIs every half year.
  4. System generates scores and performance reports.
  5. Manager views reports per employee or entire year.
